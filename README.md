## Objective and Instructions
Grade Averager is a program that will read in names of students and grades from an input file named grades.txt, find the average of those grades, and then output the corresponding letter grade for each student to the screen. The program uses a class which is used to find the average of the grades in a list. In addition to finding the average of the grades, the program also writes to an output file called summary.txt which includes the number of students, the total average of all of the students; grades, the highest grade, the lowest grade, and the student with the longest name.
